If Copilot stops responding:

Reload the VS Code window (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window")
Sign out and back in to the Copilot extension (Ctrl+Shift+P → "GitHub Copilot: Sign Out", then sign back in)
Check the Copilot output panel (View → Output → select "GitHub Copilot" from dropdown) for error messages
Verify your GitHub token hasn't expired or been revoked in account settings
To prevent hangs:

Keep conversation summaries brief rather than extremely long exchanges (though ours is well-documented)
If a response takes >30 seconds, interrupt and try rephrasing the request
Avoid pasting extremely large code blocks in single messages; reference files instead
For this project specifically:

I have full context from our conversation history, so you can jump directly to the next task without re-explaining background
Ready to move forward—shall we get back to diagnosing the virtual keyboard audio issue, or is there something else you'd like to tackle?
