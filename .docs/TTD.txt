Remove Outside Scale Configuration Wrapper
Move Staff Formatting Outside of Duration & Direction 

Here’s a list of the inline <script> blocks 
in create-scales.html that could be exported to .js files:
Line 41: <script> (after header-fetch.js)
Line 52: <script>
Line 71: <script>
Line 200: <script>
Line 519: <script>
Line 559: <script>
Line 656: <script>
Line 671: <script>
Line 686: <script>

==================
Move inline scripts to external .js files: As discussed, this keeps your HTML focused on structure and content.
Organize with clear HTML comments: Mark major sections (header, controls, main content, footer) for easy navigation.
Group related elements: Use <section>, <div>, or <fieldset> to visually and semantically group controls and UI blocks.
Consistent indentation and formatting: Use a formatter (like VS Code’s built-in HTML formatter) for readability.
Remove unused code: Delete commented-out or obsolete markup/scripts.
Minimize inline styles: Move styles to your CSS files (site.css, etc.) for maintainability.
Use semantic HTML tags: Prefer <main>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, etc., for better accessibility and structure.
Add a “table of contents” comment at the top: List major sections and their line numbers for quick reference.
Consolidate repeated markup: If you see repeated blocks, consider making them into reusable components (even if just copy-paste for now).
Check for broken or duplicate IDs: Ensure all id attributes are unique and match your JS selectors.

using best practices as defined in migration-outline.md 
add the following content to create-scales.html
Add a "Scale Configuration"
DaisyUI "Collapse Block" that contains the contols that can be found in 
public/prototype/show-scales.html 
this new routine should be created in alpha/scripts/ui/create-scales.js

Refactor the VexFlow "Scale Display" in alpha/create-scales.html such that 
it displays musical stafs using buildScaleFromUI
any  new routine direclty affecting UI should be created in alpha/scripts/ui/scales.js



=============================

CMT Scale generator
===================

Create  a new routine
named buildScaleFromUI with the following
arguments and correisponding defaluts 
if no argument is given 
Key
Scale Type
Octaves
Direction
Note Duration
and Accidentals
should be created in alpha/scripts/utils

as can be found in public/prototype/show-scales.html


this new routine should be created in alpha/scripts/utils/

Diagnostic
at the bottom of alpha/create-scales.html
a Collapse Block entitled "Diagnostics: Behind the Curtain" 
which shows the arguments sent to buildScaleFromUI
and the notes scale returned
