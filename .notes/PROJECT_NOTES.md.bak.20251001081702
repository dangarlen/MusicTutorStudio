# Project Notes — Euphonium Tutor

This is a persistent, structured single-file tracker intended to be the canonical place for:

- Revision notes (what changed and why)
- Known bug list (repro steps, severity, status)
- TTD / Tests To Do (explicit test cases to run)
- Future features / roadmap (scoped and prioritized)

Guidelines

- Keep entries short and date-stamped (YYYY-MM-DD). Use verbs and a reproducible steps section for bugs.
- Prefer linking to a GitHub Issue when a bug or feature is actionable. Use `#NN` once you create the issue.
- Use the Trouble → Fix → Verify pattern for every bug entry.

Usage examples (copyable templates)

- Revision note

  - 2025-10-01 — Upgraded Live Server root to `/public` to serve index.html directly. (PR: #123)

- Known bug

  - ID: BUG-001
  - Title: Live Preview opens directory instead of index.html
  - First reported: 2025-09-30
  - Severity: medium
  - Environment: Windows 10, Live Server extension
  - Steps to reproduce:
    1. Open workspace root
    2. Click Live Server → Go Live
  - Observed: Browser shows directory listing
  - Expected: `public/index.html` loads
  - Notes / root cause: Live Server was serving `/` instead of `/public`
  - Fix: Set `liveServer.settings.root = "/public"` in `.vscode/settings.json`
  - Status: fixed (2025-10-01)

- Test case (TTD)

  - ID: TTD-001
  - Title: Show Scales — Render major scale and display fingering
  - Steps:
    1. Open `public/show-scales.html`
    2. Select Instrument: "Euphonium"
    3. Root note: C, Octaves: 1, Display: fingering
    4. Press render
  - Expected: VexFlow SVG draws scale and fingering annotations appear for each note
  - Status: todo

- Future feature
  - ID: FTR-001
  - Title: Persist user preferences to localStorage plus export/import
  - Priority: P2
  - Notes: Currently prefs use cookies; migrating to localStorage simplifies sync.

## How I can help (ways I can assist you)

- Convert your current freeform notes from `.notes/Coding_Notes.txt` into this structured format (I can copy/paste or summarise).
- Create GitHub Issues automatically from items you flag (requires repository permission and GitHub token).
- Add a simple script to render this file into a checklist or generate a Kanban board markdown (local HTML) for quick review.

Small next step suggestion: if you want, reply "MIGRATE" and I'll read your existing `.notes/Coding_Notes.txt` and propose a set of items extracted into this file.
